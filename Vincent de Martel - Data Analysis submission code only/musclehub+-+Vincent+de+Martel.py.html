# # Capstone Project 1: MuscleHub AB Test

# ## Step 1: Get started with SQL

# Like most businesses, Janet keeps her data in a SQL database.  Normally, you'd download the data from her database to a csv file, and then load it into a Jupyter Notebook using Pandas.
# 
# For this project, you'll have to access SQL in a slightly different way.  You'll be using a special Codecademy library that lets you type SQL queries directly into this Jupyter notebook.  You'll have pass each SQL query as an argument to a function called `sql_query`.  Each query will return a Pandas DataFrame.  Here's an example:

# In[1]:


# This import only needs to happen once, at the beginning of the notebook
from codecademySQL import sql_query


# In[2]:


# Here's an example of a query that just displays some data
sql_query('''
SELECT *
FROM visits
LIMIT 5
''')


# In[3]:


# Here's an example where we save the data to a DataFrame
df = sql_query('''
SELECT *
FROM applications
LIMIT 5
''')


# ## Step 2: Get your dataset

# Let's get started!
# 
# Janet of MuscleHub has a SQLite database, which contains several tables that will be helpful to you in this investigation:
# - `visits` contains information about potential gym customers who have visited MuscleHub
# - `fitness_tests` contains information about potential customers in "Group A", who were given a fitness test
# - `applications` contains information about any potential customers (both "Group A" and "Group B") who filled out an application.  Not everyone in `visits` will have filled out an application.
# - `purchases` contains information about customers who purchased a membership to MuscleHub.
# 
# Use the space below to examine each table.

# In[34]:


# Examine visits here
sql_query('''select * from visits order by visit_date desc limit 5 ''')


# In[35]:


# Examine fitness_tests here
sql_query('''select * from fitness_tests order by fitness_test_date desc limit 5''') 


# In[6]:


# Examine applications here
sql_query('''select * from applications limit 5''')


# In[36]:


# Examine purchases here
sql_query('''select * from purchases order by purchase_date desc limit 5''')


# We'd like to download a giant DataFrame containing all of this data.  You'll need to write a query that does the following things:
# 
# 1. Not all visits in  `visits` occurred during the A/B test.  You'll only want to pull data where `visit_date` is on or after `7-1-17`.
# 
# 2. You'll want to perform a series of `LEFT JOIN` commands to combine the four tables that we care about.  You'll need to perform the joins on `first_name`, `last_name`, and `email`.  Pull the following columns:
# 
# 
# - `visits.first_name`
# - `visits.last_name`
# - `visits.gender`
# - `visits.email`
# - `visits.visit_date`
# - `fitness_tests.fitness_test_date`
# - `applications.application_date`
# - `purchases.purchase_date`
# 
# Save the result of this query to a variable called `df`.
# 
# Hint: your result should have 5004 rows.  Does it?
# select visits.first_name, visits.last_name,visits.gender,visits.email,visits.visit_date,fitness_tests.fitness_test_date,applications.application_date,purchases.purchase_date from visits
# left join fitness_tests on visits.first_name=fitness_tests.first_name, visits.last_name=fitness_tests.last_name,visits.email=fitness_tests.email where visits.visit_date > 7-1-17
# 
# 

# In[8]:


df=sql_query('''
select visits.first_name, visits.last_name,visits.gender,visits.email,visits.visit_date,fitness_tests.fitness_test_date,applications.application_date,purchases.purchase_date
from visits
left join fitness_tests
on visits.first_name=fitness_tests.first_name and visits.last_name=fitness_tests.last_name and visits.email=fitness_tests.email
left join applications
on visits.first_name=applications.first_name and visits.last_name=applications.last_name and visits.email=applications.email
left join purchases
on visits.first_name=purchases.first_name and visits.last_name=purchases.last_name and visits.email=purchases.email
where visits.visit_date >= '7-1-17'
''')


# ## Step 3: Investigate the A and B groups

# We have some data to work with! Import the following modules so that we can start doing analysis:
# - `import pandas as pd`
# - `from matplotlib import pyplot as plt`

# In[9]:


import pandas as pd
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
df.head(5)


# We're going to add some columns to `df` to help us with our analysis.
# 
# Start by adding a column called `ab_test_group`.  It should be `A` if `fitness_test_date` is not `None`, and `B` if `fitness_test_date` is `None`.

# In[10]:


mylambda= lambda x: 'A' if x else 'B'
df['ab_test_group']=""
for row in range(len(df)):
    df['ab_test_group'][row]=mylambda(df['fitness_test_date'][row])
df.head(3)


# Let's do a quick sanity check that Janet split her visitors such that about half are in A and half are in B.
# 
# Start by using `groupby` to count how many users are in each `ab_test_group`.  Save the results to `ab_counts`.

# In[11]:


ab_counts=df.groupby('ab_test_group').ab_test_group.count()
ab_counts


# We'll want to include this information in our presentation.  Let's create a pie cart using `plt.pie`.  Make sure to include:
# - Use `plt.axis('equal')` so that your pie chart looks nice
# - Add a legend labeling `A` and `B`
# - Use `autopct` to label the percentage of each group
# - Save your figure as `ab_test_pie_chart.png`

# In[37]:


plt.pie(ab_counts,labels=['Group A (fitness test)','Group B (no fitness test)'],autopct='%0.1f%%')
plt.axis('equal')
plt.savefig('musclehub_pie1.png')
plt.show()


# ## Step 4: Who picks up an application?

# Recall that the sign-up process for MuscleHub has several steps:
# 1. Take a fitness test with a personal trainer (only Group A)
# 2. Fill out an application for the gym
# 3. Send in their payment for their first month's membership
# 
# Let's examine how many people make it to Step 2, filling out an application.
# 
# Start by creating a new column in `df` called `is_application` which is `Application` if `application_date` is not `None` and `No Application`, otherwise.

# In[13]:


step2lambda= lambda x: 'Application' if x else 'No Application'
df['is_application']=''
for row in range(len(df)):
    df['is_application'][row]=step2lambda(df['application_date'][row])
df.head(5)


# Now, using `groupby`, count how many people from Group A and Group B either do or don't pick up an application.  You'll want to group by `ab_test_group` and `is_application`.  Save this new DataFrame as `app_counts`

# In[14]:


app_counts=df.groupby(['ab_test_group','is_application']).email.count().reset_index()
print type(app_counts)
app_counts


# We're going to want to calculate the percent of people in each group who complete an application.  It's going to be much easier to do this if we pivot `app_counts` such that:
# - The `index` is `ab_test_group`
# - The `columns` are `is_application`
# Perform this pivot and save it to the variable `app_pivot`.  Remember to call `reset_index()` at the end of the pivot!

# In[15]:


app_pivot=app_counts.pivot(index='ab_test_group',columns='is_application').reset_index()
print app_pivot


# Define a new column called `Total`, which is the sum of `Application` and `No Application`.

# In[16]:


app_pivot['Total']=app_pivot['email']['Application']+app_pivot['email']['No Application']
app_pivot


# Calculate another column called `Percent with Application`, which is equal to `Application` divided by `Total`.

# In[17]:


app_pivot['Percent']=app_pivot['email']['Application']/app_pivot['Total']
app_pivot.style.format({'Percent': '{:.2%}'})
app_pivot


# It looks like more people from Group B turned in an application.  Why might that be?
# 
# We need to know if this difference is statistically significant.
# 
# Choose a hypothesis tests, import it from `scipy` and perform it.  Be sure to note the p-value.
# Is this result significant?

# In[18]:


from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency
X=[[250,2254],[325,2175]]
chi2, pval, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(X)
print 'The p-value is',"{:.3%}".format(pval),' which means we can confidently reject the hypothesis that the results of the A and B groups are statistically identical'
print 'People who took the fitness test are less likely to turn in an application'
print 'One of the interviews has a very negative comment about the fitness test, saying he regretted it'


# ## Step 4: Who purchases a membership?

# Of those who picked up an application, how many purchased a membership?
# 
# Let's begin by adding a column to `df` called `is_member` which is `Member` if `purchase_date` is not `None`, and `Not Member` otherwise.

# In[19]:


df['is_member']=''
memberlambda= lambda x: 'Member' if x else 'Not Member'
df['is_member']=''
for row in range(len(df)):
    df['is_member'][row]=memberlambda(df['purchase_date'][row])
df.head(5)


# Now, let's create a DataFrame called `just_apps` the contains only people who picked up an application.

# In[20]:


just_apps=df[df.is_application=='Application']
print len(just_apps),'people turned in an application.'
just_apps.head(5)


# Great! Now, let's do a `groupby` to find out how many people in `just_apps` are and aren't members from each group.  Follow the same process that we did in Step 4, including pivoting the data.  You should end up with a DataFrame that looks like this:
# 
# |is_member|ab_test_group|Member|Not Member|Total|Percent Purchase|
# |-|-|-|-|-|-|
# |0|A|?|?|?|?|
# |1|B|?|?|?|?|
# 
# Save your final DataFrame as `member_pivot`.

# In[21]:


member=just_apps.groupby(['is_member','ab_test_group']).email.count().reset_index()
member
member_pivot=member.pivot(index='ab_test_group',columns='is_member').reset_index()
member_pivot['Total']=member_pivot['email']['Member']+member_pivot['email']['Not Member']
member_pivot['Percent Purchase']=member_pivot['email']['Member']/member_pivot['Total']
member_pivot


# It looks like people who took the fitness test were more likely to purchase a membership **if** they picked up an application.  Why might that be?
# 
# Just like before, we need to know if this difference is statistically significant.  Choose a hypothesis tests, import it from `scipy` and perform it.  Be sure to note the p-value.
# Is this result significant?

# In[22]:


from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency
Y=[[50,250],[75,325]]
chi2, pval2, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(Y)
print 'The p-value is',"{:.3%}".format(pval2)
print 'This means that there is a 54% probability that the results are the same. We cannot reject the null hypothesis.'
print 'In other words, we cannot claim that taking the fitness test made a difference to the results for people who made an application.'


# Previously, we looked at what percent of people **who picked up applications** purchased memberships.  What we really care about is what percentage of **all visitors** purchased memberships.  Return to `df` and do a `groupby` to find out how many people in `df` are and aren't members from each group.  Follow the same process that we did in Step 4, including pivoting the data.  You should end up with a DataFrame that looks like this:
# 
# |is_member|ab_test_group|Member|Not Member|Total|Percent Purchase|
# |-|-|-|-|-|-|
# |0|A|?|?|?|?|
# |1|B|?|?|?|?|
# 
# Save your final DataFrame as `final_member_pivot`.

# In[23]:


final_member=df.groupby(['is_member','ab_test_group']).email.count().reset_index()
print len(df[df.is_member=='Member']),'people became members.'
print len(df[df.is_member=='Not Member']),'did not become members.'
final_member_pivot=final_member.pivot(index='ab_test_group',columns='is_member').reset_index()
final_member_pivot['Total']=final_member_pivot['email']['Member']+final_member_pivot['email']['Not Member']
final_member_pivot['Percent Purchase']=final_member_pivot['email']['Member']/final_member_pivot['Total']
final_member_pivot


# Previously, when we only considered people who had **already picked up an application**, we saw that there was no significant difference in membership between Group A and Group B.
# 
# Now, when we consider all people who **visit MuscleHub**, we see that there might be a significant different in memberships between Group A and Group B.  Perform a significance test and check.

# In[24]:


from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency
Z=[[200,2304],[250,2250]]
chi2, pval3, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(Z)
print 'The p-value is',"{:.3%}".format(pval3), 'meaning that the difference is significant.'


# ## Step 5: Summarize the acquisition funel with a chart

# We'd like to make a bar chart for Janet that shows the difference between Group A (people who were given the fitness test) and Group B (people who were not given the fitness test) at each state of the process:
# - Percent of visitors who apply
# - Percent of applicants who purchase a membership
# - Percent of visitors who purchase a membership
# 
# Create one plot for **each** of the three sets of percentages that you calculated in `app_pivot`, `member_pivot` and `final_member_pivot`.  Each plot should:
# - Label the two bars as `Fitness Test` and `No Fitness Test`
# - Make sure that the y-axis ticks are expressed as percents (i.e., `5%`)
# - Have a title
